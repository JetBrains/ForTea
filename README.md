Things to know about this ReSharper plugin
----
As a ReSharper plugin, ForTea doesn't provide any Visual Studio service,
meaning there are some limitations.
Among those, syntax highlighting is fully handled by ReSharper rather than Visual Studio:
to get coloring for identifiers, you must enable _Color identifiers_ in _ReSharper Options > Code Inspection > Settings_.
Plus, there is no code outlining support yet.

Visual Basic T4 files aren't supported yet.
Custom T4 directives aren't supported yet.
